# Chemistry-And-Art

The RGB Converter is a very rough Python script (for 3.x) designed to convert RGB values into 0-255 HSL values. I want to emphasize that it's not a beautiful piece of code but works much more quickly (and more "black-boxy" now) than my calculator does. Its only real application was for a series of labs in a Chemistry and Art class.
